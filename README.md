# Cellular Automata 3D
A small personal project, simulating the behavior of cellular automata in 3-dimensional space, with hardcoded rules. I hope to add an interface for user-input simulation rules.

## Features:
- 3D visualization of cells
- Adjustable camera controls for 360¬∞ viewing
- Toggleable gridlines
- Pause, play, and speed control functionalities
- Shadowing based on cell density

## Controls:

1. **Mouse Left Button**: Toggle drawing cubes
2. **Mouse Right Button**: Toggle gridlines
3. **SPACE**: Play/Pause the simulation
4. **Arrow Up/Down**: Increase/Decrease the FPS, thereby controlling the simulation speed
5. **Mouse Drag**: Adjust the camera view
6. **Mouse Scroll**: Zoom in/out
