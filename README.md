# Cellular-Automata-3D
A small personal project, simulating the behavior of cellular automata in 3-dimensional space, with hardcoded rules. I hope to add an interface for user-input simulation rules.

controls:
        mouse movement = camera movement
        left click     = hide/show the 3D cells
        space bar      = pause/unpause
        up arrow key   = increase FPS
        down arrow key = decrease FPS
